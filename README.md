## About The Project

Taking frequent breaks while using a computer can significantly help to reduce eye strain caused by prolonged use of computer. Frequent breaks also let you to rest not only your eyes but also do other things like stretching, staying hyrdrated and something else. [Twenty twenty](https://github.com/m-visaya/twenty-twenty) reduces the hassle and need for remembering when to take a break. Different break time intervals can be set within the app as well as other customization settings. The idea of creating this app as well as its name is heavily inspired by the [20-20-20](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule) rule.
